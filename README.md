## Abstract

This paper proposes a computational framework for modeling pre-symbolic concept formation in artificial agents using hyperbolic geometry. Inspired by speculative models of infant cognitive development, it hypothesizes that conceptual structure can emerge from internally generated structured noise — analogous to biological phosphenes or cortical spontaneous activity — self-organizing into stable geometric tilings within the Poincaré disk.
